# Predicting Popularity of an Online News Article

Using UCI's [Online News Popularity Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity), I perform statistical tests to measure the significance of certain variables on the number of social media shares an article receives. During my exploratory data analysis, I create graphs that answer some of my objective questions. I then create a linear regression model, from which I can infer the strongest predictors based on the coefficients within the model.
